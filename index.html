        <h1>BabysitBuddies Support</h1>

        <p>Welcome to the BabysitBuddies support page! BabysitBuddies is a marketplace app connecting parents with trusted babysitters for easy childcare booking.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-question">What is BabysitBuddies?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">BabysitBuddies is a mobile app that connects parents with verified babysitters in their area. It allows parents to easily find, book, and pay for childcare services. Babysitters can use the app to manage their availability, showcase their experience, and grow their client base.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">How do I book a babysitter?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>To book a babysitter, simply browse available sitters in your area, view their profiles and reviews, and select a date and time that works for you. You can then securely book and pay through the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">How do I contact a babysitter?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">You can contact a babysitter directly through the app's messaging feature. You can discuss your specific childcare needs, house rules, and any special instructions before finalizing the booking.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">I'm a babysitter. How do I sign up?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Babysitters can create a profile directly within the BabysitBuddies app. You'll need to provide your information, experience, certifications (such as CPR/First Aid), and set your availability to start accepting bookings. All sitters go through a verification process for parents' peace of mind.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">How are babysitters verified?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">We take safety seriously. All babysitters on our platform undergo a background check, identity verification, and must provide references. Parents can also view ratings and reviews from other families who have used their services.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">What if I need to cancel a booking?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Plans change, and we understand that. Parents can cancel bookings according to the cancellation policy (viewable before booking). Most last-minute cancellations may incur a small fee to compensate the sitter for their reserved time. Sitters are held to strict cancellation policies to ensure reliability.</div>
